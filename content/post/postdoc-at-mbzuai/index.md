Since June 16th, I have been a Postdoctoral Associate at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), working with Dr. Nils Lukas in the Secure, Private, Open, and Trustworthy (SPOT) AI Lab.

The research environment at MBZUAI is highly stimulating and collaborative. The SPOT Lab brings together talented researchers passionate about advancing the security, privacy, and reliability of AI systems. Working with Dr. Lukas is both intellectually enriching and professionally motivating.

Beyond the academic setting, the university offers an exceptionally well-organized and efficient environment. Life in the UAE has also proven to be remarkably safe and convenientâ€”features that make settling in both quick and pleasant.

Originally from Fiorano Modenese (Modena, Italy), I continue to cherish my Italian roots (and cuisine!) while embracing the vibrant and innovative atmosphere of Abu Dhabi.
