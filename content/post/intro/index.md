I was born on January 17, 1994, and grew up in Fiorano Modenese, a small town in northern Italy known as the land of Ferrari—and not just because of nearby Maranello. Fiorano is home to Ferrari’s private test track, and some of my earliest memories are of my father taking me there to watch Michael Schumacher testing the scarlet Formula 1 cars. Since then, I have remained a lifelong Ferrari and Formula 1 enthusiast, through both the triumphs and the challenging seasons.

Beyond technology, I have always been deeply passionate about music and performance. I’m a drummer, guitarist, and singer, and I’ve performed as both a singer and actor in a small musical group in my hometown. I’ve always sought a balance between creativity and logic, which continues to guide how I approach both research and life.

I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, followed by a Ph.D. (May 2025) jointly between the University of Pisa (UNIPI) and the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE), where my work focused on safe and responsible artificial intelligence.

During my doctoral studies, I completed a research internship at Meta GenAI, where I worked on large language model (LLM) safety under the mentorship of Cristian Canton Ferrer and Jianfeng Chi. I remain actively engaged in international research projects aimed at building more secure, transparent, and trustworthy AI systems.

I am now based in Abu Dhabi as a Postdoctoral Associate at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), where I work with Dr. Nils Lukas in the Secure, Private, Open, and Trustworthy (SPOT) AI Lab.
