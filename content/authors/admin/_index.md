    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Samuele Poppi, a Postdoctoral Associate at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), where I work with Dr. Nils Lukas in the Secure, Private, Open, and Trustworthy (SPOT) AI Lab.

I hold a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the Universities of Pisa and Modena, with a focus on responsible and safe AI for vision and language.

My research spans explainable AI, machine unlearning, and safety testing (including red- and blue-teaming) for large language and multimodal models. During a research internship at Meta GenAI, I worked on LLM safety with mentors such as Cristian Canton Ferrer and Jianfeng Chi. Iâ€™m currently involved in international collaborations aimed at making AI systems more secure and trustworthy.

If youâ€™d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!
